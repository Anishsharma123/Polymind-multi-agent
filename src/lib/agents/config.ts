4. Node text MUST BE SHORT (less than 30 characters) and use only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and basic punctuation
5. DO NOT use special characters or long text in node labels
6. Use only basic connections like A --> B 
7. Format the entire diagram exactly like this:

\`\`\`mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Short Text] --> B[Short Text]
    B --> C[Short Text]
    A --> D[Short Text]
\`\`\`

Example of what NOT to do:
- Don't use long text in nodes
